#todo_list using django

this is an web based todolist app performing CRUD operation 
I followed a web tutorial to make this app only to  understand how to use node(react) and python(django together)
i connected proxy using axiom in react to communicate between frontend and backend where django runs in localhost:8000 and react app runs in localhost:3000
then i send message-todo(JSON object) to the django server from localhost:3000 
i created some class called Modal and todo in server
